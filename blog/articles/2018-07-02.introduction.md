  <h2>Introductions</h2>
  <p>This is step-0 in an effort to create a new, central and simple place for me to publish thoughts. See, I write a lot, but
    I don&rsquo;t tend to keep much of it. It all ends up scattered to various forums, or StackOverflow, or Slack. Some articles
    end up on Medium, but not nearly enough of them to establish a base there. On top of that, creating, copying, and pasting
    gists which may end up poorly formatted just isn&rsquo;t sufficient for the level of nerdy I am capable of hitting. I
    could Ghost; I could do several other things, but I need hosting taken care of, I need a simple system, and I need to
    be hands-on.</p>
  <p>That, dear reader, is the reason I am embarking on this endeavour. By going down this rabbit-hole, I intend to use some
    LEAN practices, and some just-in-time architecture, to progressively build myself a blogging platform. If that sounds
    crazy, well, perhaps it is. But it will be at least partially fun.</p>

  <p>We shall start off on the right foot, by getting a sense of what the customer wants in a product, and thus, what they need.
    In this case, the client is myself&hellip; unfortunately for me, I am not sure entirely what I want. I am, however, willing
    to be a little flexible with the product, in turn.</p>

  <h3>Requirements</h3>
  <p>Most of my product concerns right now are as follows:
    <br>
    <h4>Content-creation</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>I want a &ldquo;simple&rdquo; markup language for writing posts in</li>
      <li>I want that language to support code-highlighting, and basic theming</li>
      <li>I also want that language to support images, and I want those images syled and positioned for different purposes</li>
      <li>I want to be able to change the theme, without being tied to one look; but I want theming to be relatively straightforward</li>
      <li>I would like to schedule publishing ahead of time, so that I am not in a position where I need to be up early (or late),
        to have content on a schedule</li>
      <li>I need a
        <em>relatively</em> safe space to put my blog content</li>
      <li>I would
        <em>like</em> a process that takes care of all building and publishing</li>
      <li>I would like an earnest sense of how many people read the blog, and where they came from, so that I can consider future
        content
      </li>
      <li>I would like to keep all revision history of posts, to allow for updating stale content, and reviewing shifts in understanding</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Content-consumption</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>On the display side, I would like to have the ability to navigate from post to post, with no reloads of the browser</li>
      <li>I
        <em>require</em> TLS support over https</li>
      <li>I want both a view for reading blogs, as well as a view for finding them; whether through navigation, or also search</li>
      <li>I would like some form of feedback available, even if that is through
        <a aria-label="Twitter profile of Sean May" href="https://twitter.com/seanjmay">Twitter</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>The Plan</h3>
  <p>For the bare-minimum, I already know that this is going to be hosted as a GitHub Pages site, for the immediate future.
    That takes care of some problems (TLS / hosting), and causes some others (simple publishing pipelines).</p>
  <p>With my
    <a aria-label="information about Product Owners" href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-product-owner">Product Owner</a> hat firmly upon my head, I feel that the most valuable feature this product could have is a markup
    language with less friction than HTML. The most business value right now can come from lightening the burden of writing
    content, and making that aspect smoother.</p>
  <p>With my architect&rsquo;s hat on, I can already see challenges with that feature. Right now, I am typing HTML, by hand,
    and because the site is a GitHub Pages site, there is no backend. Thus the HTML being written is baked directly into
    the page. Turning it into a different language that is baked into the page is going to become even messier. Even after
    I switch languages, I have the technical hurdle of sending a clean-up crew through this HTML file, to pull out the content
    that shouldn&rsquo;t be baked into the page in the first place. But baby steps.</p>
  <p>Thankfully, GitHub will allow XHR calls, and will respond with other static assets. With a few simple tasks, I can probably
    have that feature done inside of a couple of hours of work. I also know that there are Markdown parsers which happen
    to work on the front-end, and Markdown is a pleasant-enough language to work with. Even if it&rsquo;s not the language
    we use at the end of this product, it is more than good enough for the start; I should just make a mental note to not
    bake the assumption of Markdown into everything.</p>

  <h3>Next Steps</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>tag the repo, so that this atrocity is accessible in this state, for the rest of time</li>
    <li>Start a todo list (in-repo is fine for now; reasses and grab a Trello board later, if need be)</li>
    <li>assume Markdown, and assess libraries for parsing text in an .md compatible format into a format that can be incorporated
      into a webpage</li>
    <li>get XHR (Fetch) working with markdown, parser, and HTML inclusion</li>
    <li>blog about it, on the next iteration of the platform</li>
  </ul>
